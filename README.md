# airline-profit-maximization

**Cmpe160 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming**  
**Project 1**

Programming project where we try to maximize the airline's profits by doing given operations.


### Operations: 

1. To fly an aircraft from one airport to another.  
2. Assigning any type of aircraft to an airport.  
3. Adding fuel to an aircraft.  
4. Loading a passenger to an aircraft.  
5. Disembarking a passenger from an aircraft.  
6. Transfering a passenger from an aircraft to another.

### Algorithm:

In my algorithm, I do not transport economy and business passengers since their ticket fees do not compensate for their loading, unloading, and operation fees. Find first-class and luxury passengers and look where they want to go. Find a path between the airport where passengers are and where they want to go which makes fuel prices as low as possible and select an aircraft type to make the flight. Then add the minimum required fuel, load the passengers, and make the flight. When passengers can disembark at that airport, unload them.
